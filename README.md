# Disease-Prevalence-Analysis-Project
An end-to-end data analysis project focused on Disease trends in a college student community at Nnewi, Anambra Nigeria  from 2021-2023. I use Excel to demonstrate hands-on data manipulation and R for reproducible analysis, revealing key insights on disease prevalence, seasonal trends, and demographic relationships.
