## Overview
# Disease-Prevalence-Analysis-Project
An end-to-end data analysis project focused on Disease trends in a college student community at Nnewi, Anambra Nigeria  from 2021-2023. I use Excel to demonstrate hands-on data manipulation and R for reproducible analysis, revealing key insights on disease prevalence, seasonal trends, and demographic relationships.

The goal was to identify key trends in disease prevalence, patient demographics, and departmental visits. The analysis demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and professional data visualization.

## Business Problem
To analyze patient data and identify the most common diseases, understand their distribution across different patient demographics, and track their prevalence over time.

## Key Insights
- **Disease Prevalence:** [Based on your analysis, state the most common diseases.]
- **Demographic Trends:** [Based on your analysis, provide a key insight on how age and gender relate to disease prevalence. For example, "Males and females showed similar disease patterns, but females had a higher rate of..."]
- **Departmental Insights:** [Based on your analysis, provide a key insight on department trends. For example, "The EHS department saw a significant increase in cases from 2022 to 2023."]
- **Yearly Trends:** [Based on your analysis, provide an insight on how the top diseases have changed over the years. For example, "The time-series analysis showed a consistent rise in respiratory and eye disorder cases from 2021 to 2023, while skin-related issues remained relatively stable."]
- **Seasonal Trends:** **[Based on your analysis, provide a key insight on seasonal trends. For example, "Respiratory diseases spiked during the winter months, while skin disorders were more prevalent in the summer."]**

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Cleaning & Manipulation:** Microsoft Excel, R (dplyr, tidyr, readxl, lubridate)
- **Visualization & Dashboarding:** Microsoft Excel, R (ggplot2, flexdashboard)
- **Version Control & Hosting:** Git, GitHub

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the original and cleaned datasets.
- `code/`: Contains the R script used for cleaning and analysis.
- `dashboard/`: Contains the final `dashboard.html` file.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides a project overview.
